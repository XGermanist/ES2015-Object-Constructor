# ES2015-Object-Constructor
Object Construcor and modificator based on ES2015 features â€” homework 13 in Skillbox course

Homework for the 13th module in the Skillbox JavaScript course. An advanced version of the constructor script allowing to create sub-class objects (car - plane - ship) inheriting properties from the Vehicle class, but also with their own properties and methods. The syntax is now done in ES 2015. The buttons toggle methods allowing to create sub-class objects, show their specs and modify the objects.
